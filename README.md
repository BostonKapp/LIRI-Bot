# LIRI-Bot
Making a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

The Liri app is for returning information from API's in the terminal. The user should be able to give commands in the terminal to get where a band is playing in town, the venue, the date, and the name of the location. Given another command the liri app should be able to take the name of the song and return the artist name, the album which the song is one, and a link to spotify to listen to the song.
